Reflection 13th july

1. To implement recursion, first implement the base or the stopping condition.
2. Ctrl-Alt-k kills an entire expression.
3. When unsure about the number of arguments that will be passed to a function we use &, as in (defn func [ arg1 & rest] , the rest of the arguments are stored in 'rest' as a sequence.
4. Concat takes two sequences as arguments. We cannot concat a sequence and a single number.
5. Concat takes more than two sequences , while conj and cons take one sequence and one or more numbers.
6. Compliment is a special type of function which takes a function as an argument and returns a function as well.
7. Ctrl-Shift-k also kills an entire expression.


Mistakes
1. Used defn instead of def while using compliment function to create another function.
2. While writing my-complement function, returned the expression (not f) instead of a function.

1. Test Driven Development is a strategy in which we write the test cases first and then write the actual function.
2. Writing the test case makes us understand the function input, output and behaviour better.
3. We can use test libraries to write tests, clojure has a inbuilt test library called clojure.test
4. Expectations is a library to write and check tests, auto-expectations makes the job easier by running the tests everytime a test file or core file is modified and saved and lists the tests which were failed.
